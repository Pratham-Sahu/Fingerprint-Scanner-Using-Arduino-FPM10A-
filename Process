INSTALLING LIBRARIES

Sensor Libraries
1. Download the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor library. 
2. You should have a .zip folder in your Downloads folder
3. Unzip the .zip folder and you should get Adafruit-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library-master folder
4. Rename your folder from  Adafruit-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library-master folder to  Adafruit_Fingerprint_Sensor_Library folder
5. Move the folder to your Arduino IDE installation libraries folder
6. Finally, re-open your Arduino IDE

0.96 inch OLED libraries
1. Open your Arduino IDE and go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries. The Library Manager should open.
2. Type “SSD1306” in the search box and install the SSD1306 library from Adafruit.
3. After installing the SSD1306 library from Adafruit, type “GFX” in the search box and install the library.
4. After installing the libraries, restart your Arduino IDE.

ENROLL A NEW FINGERPRINT

1. In the Arduino IDE, go to File > Examples > Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library > Enroll.
2. Upload the code, and open the serial monitor at a baud rate of 9600.
3. You should enter an ID for the fingerprint. As this is your first fingerprint, type 1 at the top left corner, and then, click the Send button.
4. Place your finger on the scanner and follow the instructions on the serial monitor.

You’ll be asked to place the same finger twice on the scanner. If you get the “Prints matched!” message, as shown below, your fingerprint was 
successfully stored. If not, repeat the process, until you succeed.

FINDING A MATCH

1. In the Arduino IDE, go to File > Examples > Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library > Fingerprint and upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. Open the Serial Monitor at a baud rate of 9600.
3. Place the finger to be identified on the scan.
4. On the serial monitor, you can see the ID that matches the fingerprint. It also shows the confidence – the higher the confidence, 
   the similar the fingerprint is with the stored fingerprint.
