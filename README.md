# Fingerprint-Scanner-Using-Arduino-FPM10A-

INTRODUCTION

Fingerprint sensor modules, like the one in the following figure, made fingerprint recognition more accessible and easy to add to your projects. 
This means that is is super easy to make fingerprint collection, registration, comparison and search.
These modules come with FLASH memory to store the fingerprints and work with any microcontroller or system with TTL serial. These modules can be added to 
security systems, door locks, time attendance systems, and much more.
Prices for this sensor greatly vary from $10 to $50. We recommend checking the Fingerprint sensor module on Maker Advisor that compares the price in 
different stores. The fingerprint sensor modules featured on Maker Advisor should be compatible with this guide.
